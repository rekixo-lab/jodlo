# JODLO — current state, 2026-10-27

**Identity:** JODLO; Android `com.rekixo.jodlo`; future production domain `jodlo.rekixo.com`. Entirely independent from live Finworkar (read-only reference).

## Founder-approved development/release method
- [x] **NO staging Cloudflare environment. NO remote deployment until product code is ready.** Complete Cloudflare Worker, D1/R2/Queues, all API modules, native Android, real-provider adapters and full tests with local cloud simulations/mock adapters and GitHub CI.
- [x] First cloud deployment is a separately **founder-approved production-only** launch, after tests, backups, migration rehearsals, policies, credentials and rollback. Live provider callbacks, domain routing and Cloudflare account behavior remain `UNVERIFIED` until then.
- [x] UI navigation/layouts require founder review before UI implementation. Old Finworkar repos and live data remain untouched. Product Google Pay India preferred; Google Play Billing for eligible digital purchases, no legacy Razorpay.
- [x] Previous JODLO staging workflow and staging Wrangler config removed in decision PR; no GitHub push workflow deploys to Cloudflare.

## Verified code and CI baseline
- [x] GitHub foundation and documentation merged through PR #1 and #2; earlier green main Actions [run 40466624240](https://github.com/rekixo-lab/jodlo/actions/runs/40466624240) on commit `17e3ab16d9a7376000b22cd8aea2cea61ab6f7d1`.
- [x] Working minimal TypeScript API `GET /api/v1/health`, docs/AI handoff and 7 existing tests. These **do not** constitute a complete backend or Android app.
- [ ] **This decision PR current-head GitHub CI** must pass before merging. Green on a previous SHA does not carry forward.

## Development pending (no external deployment/blocker)
- [ ] Local D1 relational schema/migrations, indexes, delete/retention and authorization tests.
- [ ] Typed API/auth, worker profiles, service listings, category search and customer request workflows.
- [ ] Local R2 media, image validation/moderation, Queue processing, mock FCM/RTC/payment adapters.
- [ ] Native Kotlin `com.rekixo.jodlo` project and approved screens, network/offline tests, real Android device performance.
- [ ] Server-verified idempotent payment ledger, Google Pay India/Google Play Billing policy gating, refunds and callback reconciliation.
- [ ] Security, abuse throttling, integration, mock provider, migration, load and device tests; green release candidate CI.
- [ ] Production release checklist reviewed only when code is feature-complete; no arbitrary deadline.

## Manual owner tasks
**None for Cloudflare right now.** Do not request API token, account ID, DNS or staging setup. Founder feedback is required only when proposing visible UI and major product choices. Merchant/provider onboarding and Cloudflare production access wait until final launch gate.

## Next exact engineering action
1. Merge this policy decision with actual green GitHub checks.
2. Begin **local-only D1 schema + typed API contract implementation** in a new PR; update `docs/STATUS.md` and `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md` as source of truth.
3. Don't claim deployment/live validation without direct proof.
